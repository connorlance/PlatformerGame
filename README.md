# Java Platformer

This was an 11th grade milestone project where I had to create a project based on anything I was interested in. I created a basic Java platformer. It has no menus, and the only controls are left, right, and jump. The levels were made using Microsoft paint, each block in the game is 1 pixel converted from a paint document.
